# DreamForge - A Dream Visualization & Analysis Platform

## üöÄ Overview

DreamForge is an innovative platform designed to help users capture, analyze, and visualize their dreams. By leveraging AI and data visualization, it enables users to gain deeper insights into their subconscious thoughts and mental health.

Additionally, the platform groups similar dreams together through unsupervised clustering to reveal deeper patterns and trends over time.

## üéØ Problem Statement

- Many people are curious about the meaning of their dreams but lack the tools to capture and analyze them.
- Dreams can offer valuable insights into mental well-being; however, most people record their dreams informally or not at all.
- Without proper analysis, recurring themes or patterns in dreams remain hidden.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

- **React.js** with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, interactive UI.
- Charting libraries (e.g., **Chart.js**, **Recharts**) for visualizations.

### **Backend**

- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for building robust API endpoints.
- **MongoDB** for storing user data, dream logs, and analysis results.

### **AI & Data Processing**

- **Google Gemini API** for advanced AI-based dream interpretation and structured JSON responses.
- **Stable Diffusion** for generating dream visualization images.
- **Hugging Face & Sentence Transformers** for generating embeddings and assisting in clustering.
- **scikit-learn** (DBSCAN/HDBSCAN/KMeans) for unsupervised clustering.
- **Additional libraries**: Pandas, NumPy for data handling and visualization preparation.

## üåü Core Features

### **User Management**

- Secure user registration, authentication, and profile customization.

### **Dream Input Options**

- **Basic Input:** Title, description, date.
- **Advanced Input:** Additional details such as location, user interpretation, external influences, sleep quality, dream intensity, characters present, symbols, and mood after waking.

### **Dream Analytics & Visualization**

- **AI-Powered Analysis:**
  - Generates structured analysis including interpretation, keywords, sentiment score, emotional tone distribution, and dream type classification.
  - Produces a prompt for generating a visual representation (via Stable Diffusion).
- **Individual Dream Visualizations:**
  - Radar charts, bar charts, and word clouds for in-depth analysis.
- **Grouped Dream Analytics:**
  - Automated clustering (with options for manual adjustments) to group similar dreams.
  - Visualizations (PCA/t-SNE scatter plots, histograms, multi-line/area charts) to reveal trends over time.
- **Aggregated Analytics:**
  - Timeline/line charts to track overall dream frequency and sentiment.
  - Histograms for distribution of dream intensity and sentiment across all dreams.

### **Community Engagement**

- Share dreams publicly, comment, and interact with others.
- Bookmark and tag dreams for easier retrieval and discussion.
